## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use accesskey of f, g, l, c, and t to browse the links.

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the HTML property "accesskey=". Which enables the user to make a selection with the keyboard. See below:

```html
<a
  accesskey="f"
  href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/BertSki90"
  target="_blank"
  >Frontend Mentor</a
>
```

### Continued development

I learnt about the "accesskey=" property in HTML. I am getting more comfortable working with images and in general CSS. It is exciting to learn more properties to make my code more appealing and useful.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/accesskey) - A great guide on how to setup access keys to html so that user is able to make a selection using the keyboard.
