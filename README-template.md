## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the HTML property "accesskey=". Which enables the user to make a selection with the keyboard. See below:

```html
<a
  accesskey="f"
  href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/BertSki90"
  target="_blank"
  >Frontend Mentor</a
>
```

### Continued development

I learnt about the "accesskey=" property in HTML. I am getting more comfortable working with images and in general CSS. It is exciting to learn more properties to make my code more appealing and useful.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/accesskey) - A great guide on how to setup access keys to html so that user is able to make a selection using the keyboard.
